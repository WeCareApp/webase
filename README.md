# kickstart-simple by thereactivestack

Kickstart a simple project fast!

If you would like a more sophisticated kickstart with code splitting, see the [kickstart-hugeapp project](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-hugeapp).

Clone this project to start a simple project using Meteor, React.js and Webpack.

1. `git clone https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple.git`
1. `cd kickstart-simple`
1. `meteor`

## Windows fix
You have to remove the unix symbolic link node_modules and create a Windows symbolic link.

1. Install [this tool](http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/16226/complete-guide-to-symbolic-links-symlinks-on-windows-or-linux/) to easily create symbolic link on Windows
1. Run meteor once so that the node_modules folder is created (it will fail)
1. Set the `packages\npm-container\.npm\package\node_modules` folder as the source with right-click
1. Remove the node_modules file in the root folder, drop the symbolic link and rename it `node_modules`
    
You can also use the command-line:<br />
`MKLINK /D node_modules packages\npm-container\.npm\package\node_modules`

## The stack & features
- Include the simple todo app example
- ES6 modules
- Meteor
- React.js
- react-router with server-rendering (you can disable it by editing `server/entry.js`)
- Webpack (bundle your app / assets and send them to Meteor)
- Hot-reload with no page refresh in development mode
- Optimize your code in production mode
- Give access to NPM by using packages.json

## How does it work?
Webpack needs one [`webpack.conf.js`](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple/blob/master/modules/entry/client/webpack.conf.js) file for the client and one [`webpack.conf.js`](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple/blob/master/modules/entry/server/webpack.conf.js) for the server. It allows you to have a better control over the build process. Every other files are not automatically included by Meteor. Everything is starting from your entry point. You can also have a [`webpack.conf.js`](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple/blob/master/modules/entry/webpack.conf.js) that is shared between client and server for common settings.

The server entry point in the project is at [`modules/entry/server/entry.js`](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple/blob/master/modules/entry/server/entry.js). Everything that you want to load on your Meteor server, they have to be imported or required in some way.

The client entry point in the project is at [`modules/entry/client/entry.js`](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple/blob/master/modules/entry/server/entry.js) and work the same way as on the server, except it is run on the browser or Cordova.

You can use any package coming from NPM by adding it to [`packages.json`](https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-simple/blob/master/packages.json).

Go look at them, they are simple!

## Production
To run or build in production, you need to set your environment variable NODE_ENV to production.

You can use meteor run, meteor build, mup or anything working with Meteor.

## Run in production mode
`NODE_ENV=production meteor run --production`

## Build for production
`NODE_ENV=production meteor build .`

Then, you can run `bundle/main.js` without it.

*We are going to remove this once we have a fix that detect Meteor production mode in a compiler*

# Troubleshooting

## Module build failed: ReferenceError: Unknown plugin "react-transform"
It seems like the babel plugins are not looking into the correct directory and their is no setting to fix that. However, what you can do is create a symbolic link in your project root to the correct folder:

`ln -s packages/npm-container/.npm/package/node_modules`

*We are going to remove this step once we have a fix*
